# thunderbowlandroid
Version 1.0

This is the android studio project the the app. Find android studio here https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads.

The most straightforward way to use it without learning git is just to download the whole repository as a zip file and extracting in in your AndroidStudioProjects folder.

I have included the ThunderDome.apk in the project aswell. This can be installed on an android phone or emulator to test the app without android studio.
